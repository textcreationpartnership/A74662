            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>AFter my hearty Commendations remembred unto you, and to your wife, I thought it nece≈ø≈øary to ≈øend you the≈øe Occurrences, writing them with a ≈øad and heavy heart, by rea≈øon that there is ≈øuch a great di≈ø≈øention here, in this our County; there is no talke now in the≈øe parts but Wars, as we are very fearfull that they will en≈øue very ≈øodainly; for there is great preparations in this City, and we dare not ≈øay to the contrary: His royall Maje≈øty is re≈øolved to ≈øtay there as yet, and doth a≈ø≈øure us that there ≈øhall be nothing done contrary to the wil of this Kingdome,</p>
            <p>The great and manifold dangers which are like to en≈øue (curteous and judicious Reader) are many for the≈øe two or three yeers; but I pa≈ø≈øe them: they have been a hatching, and are now-almo≈øt dome to a full ripene≈ø≈øe, as may appeare by this en≈øuing Relation.</p>
            <p>Upon this pre≈øent moneth of May, there hath been many fears and jealou≈øies entring into the hearts of true harted Prote≈øtants in the Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therne parts of <hi>Englands,</hi> and e≈øpecially in the County of <hi>York≈øhire,</hi> and they are now fully entred more is the pity, we may all ≈øay, for they had ≈øome hopes that.

            <p>There were many a≈ø≈øembled together in a warlike manner in the County of <hi>York≈øhire,</hi> but to what intent is not yet known; but at la≈øt each man departed to his owne home; yet this is for certain that there is great preparations for war made in this County, and divers other adjoyning Counties, but to what intent is not yet known; it ≈øtrikes terrour to the hearts of all true Prote≈øtants, and maketh a great provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øion in this County, ≈øome of the Malignant party ≈øaying, that the world will never be good til there be ≈øome blood of the Puritan ≈øhed, but the Lord of his mercy ≈øend us a ≈øodain prevention, that the blood<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thir≈øty Papi≈øts may lo≈øe and mi≈ø≈øe of their intended purpo≈øes.</p>

               <p>YOV may perhaps expect that I intend to make a large Narrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on with intent to clear your doubts and make my Actions to His Maje≈øty ≈øeem (as they are) faire, Legall and Loyall.</p>
               <p>But it is not my intention, nor will I wa≈øte ≈øo much time in that bu≈øine≈ø≈øe, but leave it to the end, not doubting but when my Actions ≈øhall define their wi≈øhed event, that the end ≈øhall crowne the bad that is pa≈øt with a more full renowne. The Scope of my words at this time ≈øhall be confined to the≈øe two heads, which indeed are twins, not to be ≈øeperated.</p>
               <p>The fir≈øt is an encouragement to gaine perfect honour from your Soveraigne.</p>
               <p>Let Loyalty be the rule of all your actions, if you intend to be tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly honourable; for honour not grounded on loyalty, is like friend≈øhip without love, lo≈øt in a moment, and oft times growes the greate≈øt E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemy; to the greate≈øt Title, the va≈øte≈øt Wealth the greate≈øt Wi≈ødom,
<pb facs="tcp:110985:4"/>if not guided by Vertue, and ≈øo imployed proves ruine to the injoyer. Next, let your Loyalty take its limit from Law; otherwi≈øe, in doing things ≈øeemingly good the end may prove dangerous and your loyalty prove wor≈øe them di≈øloyalty. Therefore the next thing that I in≈øi≈øt up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on is Obedience to the Parliament, that pious and judicious Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell, whom you in particular, and all the Kingdome in generall, have cho≈øen as fit men to di≈øcu≈ø≈øe and examine all cau≈øes that have depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dency on his Maje≈øties ≈øafety, and the Kingdomes ≈øecurity. Now to di≈øallow of what is by them thought convenient both for his Maje≈øty and the Kingdomes ≈øecurity, is to condemne your ≈øelves of folly, that you have cho≈øen men in whom you cannot confide, but I pre≈øume (though there be many that the≈øe words may and doe concerne in this Kingdome) that there is no one here that would not lay downe his life for the defence of his Maje≈øty and the Parliament; neither are there any, I ≈øuppo≈øe, that need this motive to Obedience to the hono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable Hou≈øes of Parliament their owne ≈øafeties depending on the hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py i≈ø≈øue of their religious Councels.</p>
               <p>Onely my aime is, to give you one generall rea≈øon and apparent te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtimony, why the Subject being commanded by the Parliament, ought not to di≈øobey their Commands, though by the King commanded the contrary. Becau≈øe the Parliament being called and e≈øtabli≈øhed by the authority of the King and con≈øent of the Kingdom, has power to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand and effect all things that are agreeable to Law, tending to the pre≈øervation of his Maje≈øties peace and welfare, and the generall good of the Subject; they being by King and People, in tru≈øted with that waighty and great charge; and if they ≈øhould ≈øore-≈øee an imminent danger threaten his Maje≈øties Per≈øon, or the generall good and ≈øhould not take ≈øpeedy care to prevent it, they ≈øhould make a violation of that Faith and Tru≈øt repo≈øed in them: ≈øo on the contrary part, if they fore≈øeeing a danger, by their Councels and Commands endevour to prevent it; and the Per≈øons by them commanded fal≈øifie their tru≈øt; they are traytors both to their royall Soveraigne and de≈øtroyers of the Kingdome. This is the truth and this is my glory, that God has ≈øo far enabled me to undergoe ≈øo great a taske; and this is my hope that all of you will manife≈øt your loyalties to his Maje≈øty, and obedience to the Parliament.</p>
               <p>Many other matters I have to tell you concerning an Information of the Lord Keepers having left the Parliament.</p>

               <hi>Other occurrences upon Saturday,</hi> May 21. 1642.</head>
            <p>Saturday, there was a conference of both Hou≈øes; the Lords moved that the Commons would joyne with them in requiring reparations for a great breach of their priviledges; which was, that the Lords hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ≈øent Me≈ø≈øengers to <hi>Yorke,</hi> to require the attendance of ≈øome of their Members at their owne Hou≈øe, the Me≈ø≈øengers were impri≈øo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned at <hi>Yorke.</hi> Whereupon there was a Committee of both Hou≈øes to inquire thereof.</p>
            <p>After this, the Lords by a Me≈ø≈øage ≈øent certaine notes to the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons, which they had agreed upon in their Hou≈øe, concerning the Kings late proceedings at <hi>Hull</hi> and <hi>Yorke,</hi> de≈øiring the Commons would joyn with them in the notes, which were red then in the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons Hou≈øe: the effect whereof was.</p>
            <p>That it doth appeare to the Parliament, that the King being ≈øedu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced by wicked Councellours, doth intend to make warre again≈øt the Parliament; who in all their con≈øultations have propounded nothing but for the good of the Kingdome, and ≈øafety of his per≈øon.</p>
            <p>That when the King maketh war again≈øt the Parliament, it is a breach of the tru≈øt committed to him, and tendeth to the di≈ø≈øolution of this government. That who≈øoever ≈øhall a≈ø≈øi≈øt his Maje≈øty in the war are traitors, and have bin ≈øo adjudged by two Acts of Parliament; and are to ≈øuffer as traitors by the fundamentall Lawes of the Land.</p>
            <p>With their notes, the Lords ≈øent a Petition, which they had drawn up to his Maje≈øty; declaring the grounds and rea≈øons of their procee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding upon tho≈øe notes, and to di≈ø≈øwade his Maje≈øty from his intended purpo≈øe of rai≈øing the trained Bands of the County.</p>
            <p>After the reading of which Petition and notes there was a long de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bate in the Commons Hou≈øe, which held till night, and divers Speeches were made upon them, all of them concurring in the ju≈øt grounds and cau≈øes both Hou≈øes have had for the making of the ≈øaid notes, and of their agreement with the Lawes of the Land: after which, they were put to the que≈øtion, and noted by the Commons that they ≈øhould be forthwith ≈øent to <hi>Yorke</hi> to his Maje≈øty.</p>
